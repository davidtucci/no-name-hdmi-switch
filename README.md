LIRC config for unbranded 4x1 HDMI switch


I bought a no brand 4x1 HDMI switch from Amazon, with a four button remote. After much pain I have created a LIRC config file for the buttons.

I can now send the infrared commands without the remote.

Words appearing on the switch in case anyone else is searching for this:
>4K UltraHD 4x1 HDMI Switch 4K@60Hz
>HDCP 2.2 / HDMI 2.0b / 18Gpbs
>HD60 PRO 3D 4KHDR RGB8:8:8
>Made in China

*Yes, it does actually say "18Gpbs" and not Gbps*

The remote says:
>4x1
>4 Port Amplifier Selector
>Remote Control
